# Hybrid Time-Series Forecasting for Financial Markets
## Project Vision & Goal
The vision of this project is to move beyond single-model forecasting and demonstrate the superior predictive power of hybrid statistical models in the volatile domain of financial markets.

The primary goal is to build, evaluate, and compare the performance of individual ARIMA and ETS models against a more sophisticated hybrid model for forecasting the closing price of the Nifty 100 stock index.

## The Problem We Are Solving
Financial time-series data, like stock indices, is notoriously difficult to predict due to its inherent non-stationarity, volatility, and complex underlying patterns. Relying on a single forecasting model can be limiting, as different models capture different aspects of the data (e.g., ARIMA for autocorrelation, ETS for trend and seasonality). This project solves this by:

Addressing Data Complexity: Implementing a structured approach to handle non-stationary financial data through differencing and statistical testing.

Improving Predictive Accuracy: Creating a hybrid model that synthesizes the outputs of multiple models to produce a more robust and accurate forecast than any single model could achieve alone.

Providing a Framework for Financial Analysis: Building an end-to-end workflow that can be adapted to forecast other financial instruments.

## How It Works: The Forecasting Pipeline
This project follows a rigorous, multi-stage methodology:

Data Acquisition: Historical daily data for the Nifty 100 index (^CNX100) is fetched from 2007 to the present day using the yfinance library.

Stationarity Analysis: The raw time series is tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. As it is found to be non-stationary, first-order differencing is applied to make the series suitable for modeling.

Model Parameter Selection: Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots are generated on the differenced series to identify the optimal parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.

Baseline Modeling:

An ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is built and trained.

An ETS (Exponential Smoothing) model is built to capture trend and seasonality components.

Hybrid Model Development: Two hybrid forecasting techniques are implemented:

Weighted Hybrid: A simple average of the ARIMA and ETS forecasts.

Meta-Learning Hybrid (Stacking): A linear regression model is trained using the forecasts from the ARIMA and ETS models as input features, learning the optimal weights to combine them.

Evaluation: All models are rigorously evaluated against a hold-out test set using key accuracy metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

## How This Solves a Real-Life Problem
This project provides a direct, data-driven solution to key challenges in finance and investment:

Algorithmic Trading: The forecasting model can be used to generate buy/sell signals for automated trading systems, helping to capitalize on predicted price movements.

Risk Management: By predicting the direction of the market, financial institutions can better manage portfolio risk and make informed hedging decisions.

Personal Investment: Retail investors can use the forecast as a tool to support their own investment decisions, providing a statistical basis for when to enter or exit the market.

## Meeting the Objective
The project's objective—to create a superior hybrid forecasting model—was successfully met. The final evaluation showed that the Meta-Learning Hybrid model achieved the lowest error rates across all metrics, outperforming both the individual ARIMA and ETS models. This confirms the vision that blending different modeling approaches leads to a more accurate and reliable forecast.

## Scalability and Future Work
The framework built in this project is highly scalable and can be extended in several ways:

Multi-Asset Forecasting: The pipeline can be adapted to forecast other assets like individual stocks, commodities, or cryptocurrencies.

Feature Enhancement: Additional features, such as macroeconomic indicators or market sentiment data, could be incorporated to build an even more powerful multivariate model (e.g., ARIMAX or SARIMAX).

Deep Learning Integration: The hybrid model could be further enhanced by adding predictions from deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers.
